# Variational PointNet Encoder-Decoder for 3D Point Cloud Data

Welcome to the advanced Variational PointNet Encoder-Decoder repository! This project represents my endeavor to create a solution for processing and generating 3D point cloud data. It offers a range of encoding and decoding options to suit various application needs.

## Encoding Options

**1. PointNet++**
   - The PointNet++ encoder is a robust and widely-used choice for extracting features from 3D point cloud data.

**2. Convolutional Encoders**
   - My implementation includes convolutional encoders, designed to leverage spatial dependencies within the point cloud.

**3. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoding (Future Plan)**
   - Stay tuned for upcoming GNN encoding capabilities, which will further enhance your 3D data processing options.

## Decoding Options

**1. Deconvoluting Decoder**
   - The deconvoluting decoder is a powerful tool for reconstructing 3D point clouds from latent representations.

**2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Decoder**
   - My repository includes an MLP decoder, offering flexibility and efficiency in point cloud generation.

**3. Transformer-based Autoregressive Decoder (Future Plan)**
   - I am actively working on a state-of-the-art transformer-based autoregressive decoder for high-quality point cloud generation. Stay tuned for updates!
