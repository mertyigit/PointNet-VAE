# PointNet-VAE
A Variational PointNet Encoder Decoder for 3D Point Cloud data. 

I train this model in my free time and adding some capabilities. 

ENCODING:
Currently implemented encoding options:
    1) PointNet++;
    2) Convolutional Encoders;
    3) GNN Encoding (future plan)

DECODING:
Currently implemented decoding options:
    1) Deconvoluting Decoder;
    2) MLP Decoder;
    3) Transformer-based Autoregressive Decoder (future plan)
